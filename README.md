Features of the UI
User List
User List Display: A clean and organized list of users fetched from the backend.
Responsive Design: The UI will be responsive and user-friendly across different devices.
Error Handling: Proper error handling to display messages in case of any issues with data fetching.
Loading Indicator: A loading indicator to show while the data is being fetched from the backend.
Search Functionality: An optional search bar to filter users based on their names or other attributes.
Task List
Task List Display: A detailed list of tasks associated with each user.
Task Management: Ability to add, edit, and delete tasks.
Task Status: Display task status (e.g., completed, pending).
Task Filtering: Filter tasks based on status or other criteria.
Error Handling: Proper error handling to display messages in case of any issues with data fetching or task operations.
Loading Indicator: A loading indicator to show while the data is being fetched from the backend.
How It Will Be Built in ReactJS
Set Up React Project:

Use Create React App to set up the initial project structure.
Install Axios:

Install Axios to handle HTTP requests to the backend API.
Create Components:

UserList Component: A component to fetch the list of users from the backend API and display them.
UserItem Component: A component to display individual user details.
TaskList Component: A component to fetch and display tasks associated with a selected user.
TaskItem Component: A component to display individual task details.
TaskForm Component: A component to add or edit tasks.
SearchBar Component (Optional): A component to filter the displayed users and tasks based on search criteria.
State Management:

Use React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage the state of the user list and task list, and handle side effects like data fetching.
Use React's useContext or a state management library like Redux for more complex state management needs.
Styling:

Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution to style the components and ensure a responsive design.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling to display appropriate messages if there are issues with fetching data or performing task operations.
Loading Indicator:

Add a loading indicator to show while the data is being fetched from the backend.
By following these steps, you will be able to build a user interface in ReactJS to display a list of users and their associated tasks with the mentioned features.
